# GoFinance

## *GoFinance* is a simple and efficient web application that retrives your favorite stock data all in one place.
This project was built in two weeks as part of my submission for the Concordia curriculum final project. It was built with HTML, CSS, React, Express, MongoDB, Node and RESTful API.

The API used was Api DOJO's Seeking Alpha.
